### Literature
#### To Kill a Mocking Bird
* You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.
* I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.
* Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.
* People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.
* The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.
* Atticus told me to delete the adjectives and I'd have the facts.
* Sometimes the Bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whisky bottle in the hand of (another)... There are just some kind of men who - who're so busy worrying about the next world they've never learned to live in this one, and you can look down the street and see the results.
* They're certainly entitled to think that, and they're entitled to full respect for their opinions... but before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.
* Atticus said to Jem one day, "I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you’ll go after birds. Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird." That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. "Your father’s right," she said. "Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.
* As you grow older, you’ll see white men cheat black men every day of your life, but let me tell you something and don’t you forget it—whenever a white man does that to a black man, no matter who he is, how rich he is, or how fine a family he comes from, that white man is trash.
* People in their right minds never take pride in their talents.
* It was times like these when I thought my father, who hated guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who ever lived.
* With him, life was routine; without him, life was unbearable.
* Real courage is when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.
* You just hold your head high and keep those fists down. No matter what anybody says to you, don't you let 'em get your goat. Try fighting with your head for a change.
* It’s never an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name. It just shows you how poor that person is, it doesn’t hurt you.
* Things are always better in the morning.
#### Wuthering Heights
* He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.
* I wish I were a girl again, half-savage and hardy, and free.
* If he loved with all the powers of his puny being, he couldn't love as much in eighty years as I could in a day.
* Terror made me cruel . . .
* She burned too bright for this world.
* I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here? My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff's miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it. My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.
* I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death; and flung it back to me. People feel with their hearts, Ellen, and since he has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him.
* You teach me now how cruel you've been - cruel and false. Why did you despise me? Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one word of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes, you may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they'll blight you - they'll damn you. You loved me - what right had you to leave me? What right - answer me - for the poor fancy you felt for Linton? Because misery, and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, you, of your own will did it. I have no broken your heart - you have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong. Do I want to live? What kind of living will it be when you - Oh, God! would you like to lie with your soul in the grave?
* I have to remind myself to breathe -- almost to remind my heart to beat!
* My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.
* It was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn.
* It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those wasted hands,' he answered. 'Kiss me again; and don’t let me see your eyes! I forgive what you have done to me. I love my murderer—but yours! How can I?
* Honest people don't hide their deeds.
* Heaven did not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing for joy.
* He wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee. I said his heaven would be only half alive; and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall asleep in his; and he said he could not breathe in mine.
* He shall never know I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made out of, his and mine are the same.
* I’m wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there: not seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it.
* A person who has not done one half his day's work by ten o'clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.
* Treachery and violence are spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them worse than their enemies.
* Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.
#### Pride and Prejudice
* I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! -- When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.
* A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.
* It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
* There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense.
* I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.
* Angry people are not always wise.
* Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.
* There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.
* I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.
* I must learn to be content with being happier than I deserve.
* I have not the pleasure of understanding you.
* You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.
* I am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.
* To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love.
* From the very beginning— from the first moment, I may almost say— of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.
* You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.
* I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding— certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.
* Till this moment I never knew myself.
* We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.
* You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.
* A girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to think of.
* "There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."
"And your defect is a propensity to hate everybody."
"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is willfully to misunderstand them.
* Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her.
* The distance is nothing when one has a motive.
* I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.
#### The Notebook
* I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough..
* You are, and always have been, my dream.
* You are my best friend as well as my lover, and I do not know which side of you I enjoy the most. I treasure each side, just as I have treasured our life together.
* I love you. I am who I am because of you. You are every reason, every hope, and every dream I've ever had, and no matter what happens to us in the future, everyday we are together is the greatest day of my life. I will always be yours.
* We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me, love like that has only happened once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it.
* They didn’t agree on much. In fact, they didn’t agree on anything. They fought all the time and challenged each other ever day. But despite their differences, they had one important thing in common. They were crazy about each other.
* My daddy said, that the first time you fall in love, it changes you forever and no matter how hard you try, that feeling just never goes away.
* You are the answer to every prayer I've offered. You are a song, a dream, a whisper, and I don't know how I could have lived without you for as long as I have.
* In time, the hurt began to fade and it was easier to just let it go. At least I thought it was. But in every boy I met in the next few years, I found myself looking for you, and when the feelings got too strong, I'd write you another letter. But I never sent them for fear of what I might find. By then, you'd gone on with your life and I didn't want to think about you loving someone else. I wanted to remember us like we were that summer. I didn't ever want to lose that.
* The reason it hurts so much to separate is because our souls are connected. Maybe they always have been and will be. Maybe we've lived a thousand lives before this one and in each of them we've found each other. And maybe each time, we've been forced apart for the same reasons. That means that this goodbye is both a goodbye for the past ten thousand years and a prelude to what will come.
* We sit silently and watch the world around us. This has taken a lifetime to learn. It seems only the old are able to sit next to one another and not say anything and still feel content. The young, brash and impatient, must always break the silence. It is a waste, for silence is pure. Silence is holy. It draws people together because only those who are comfortable with each other can sit without speaking. This is the great paradox.
* In times of grief and sorrow I will hold you and rock you and take your grief and make it my own. When you cry I cry and when you hurt I hurt. And together we will try to hold back the floods to tears and despair and make it through the potholed street of life.
* She was my dream. She made me who I am, and holding her in my arms was more natural to me than my own heartbeat. I think about her all the time. Even now, when I'm sitting here, I think about her. There could never have been another.
* She wanted something else, something different, something more. Passion and romance, perhaps, or maybe quiet conversations in candlelit rooms, or perhaps something as simple as not being second.
* The scariest thing about distance is that you don’t know whether they’ll miss you or forget you.
* Poets often describe love as an emotion that we can't control, one that overwhelms logic and common sense. That's what it was like for me. I didn't plan on falling in love with you, and I doubt if you planned on falling in love with me. But once we met, it was clear that neither of us could control what was happening to us. We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me, love like that has happened only once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it.
* Dusk is just an illusion because the sun is either above the horizon or below it. And that means that day and night are linked in a way that few things are there cannot be one without the other yet they cannot exist at the same time. How would it feel I remember wondering to be always together yet forever apart?
* My Dearest Allie. I couldn't sleep last night because I know that it's over between us. I'm not bitter anymore, because I know that what we had was real. And if in some distant place in the future we see each other in our new lives, I'll smile at you with joy and remember how we spent the summer beneath the trees, learning from each other and growing in love. The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds, and that's what you've given me. That's what I hope to give to you forever. I love you. I'll be seeing you. 
* “A living poem" had always been the words that came to mind when he tried to describe her to others.
* Poetry, she thought, wasn't written to be analyzed; it was meant to inspire without reason, to touch without understanding.
* An ordinary beginning, something that would have been forgotten had it been anyone but her. But as he shook her hand and met those striking emerald eyes, he knew before he'd taken his next breath that she was the one he could spend the rest of his life looking for but never find again. She seemed that good, that perfect, while a summer wind blew through the trees.
* She would tell him what she wanted in her life--her hopes and dreams for the future--and he would listen intently and then promise to make it all come true. And the way he said it made her believe him, and she knew how much he meant to her.
* What are we after all our dreams, after all our memories?
* You and I were different. We came from different worlds, and yet you were the one how taught me the value of love. You showed me what it was like to care for another, and I am a better man because of it. I don't want you to ever forget that.
* No, it's not that. It's not what you're thinking. I was serious when I said 'all of it'. I can remember every moment we were together, and in each of them there was something wonderful. I can't really pick any one time that meant more than any other. The entire summer was perfect, the kind of summer everyone should have. How could I pick one moment over another? Poets often describe love as an emotion that we can't control, one that overwhelms logic and common sense. That's what it was like for me. I didn't plan on falling in love with you, and I doubt if you planned on falling in love with me. But once we met, it was clear that neither of us could control what was happening to us. We fell in love, despite our differences, and once we did, something rare and beautiful was created. For me, love like that has happened only once, and that's why every minute we spent together has been seared in my memory. I'll never forget a single moment of it.
#### The Old Man and the Sea
* Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.
* “But man is not made for defeat," he said. "A man can be destroyed but not defeated.”
* Let him think that I am more man than I am and I will be so.
* Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with that there is.
#### The Kite Runner
* For you, a thousand times over.
* It may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime...
* And that's the thing about people who mean everything they say. They think everyone else does too.
* there is only one sin, only one. And that is theft. Every other sin is a variation of theft. When you kill a man, you steal a life... you steal his wife's right to a husband, rob his children of a father. When you tell a lie, you steal someone's right to the truth. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness... there is no act more wretched than stealing.
* it always hurts more to have and lose than to not have in the first place.
* I wondered if that was how forgiveness budded; not with the fanfare of epiphany, but with pain gathering its things, packing up, and slipping away unannounced in the middle of the night.
* There are a lot of children in Afghanistan, but little childhood.
* It was only a smile, nothing more. It didn't make everything all right. It didn't make ANYTHING all right. Only a smile. A tiny thing. A leaf in the woods, shaking in the wake of a startled bird's flight. But I'll take it. With open arms. Because when spring comes, it melts the snow one flake at a time, and maybe I just witnessed the first flake melting.
* Not a word passes between us, not because we have nothing to say, but because we don't have to say anything.
* People say that eyes are windows to the soul.
* Time can be a greedy thing-sometimes it steals the details for itself.
* A man who has no conscience, no goodness, does not suffer.
* It's wrong what they say about the past, I've learned, about how you can bury it. Because the past claws its way out.
* Quiet is peace. Tranquility. Quiet is turning down the volume knob on life. Silence is pushing the off button. Shutting it down. All of it. 
* That same night, I wrote my first short story. It took me thirty minutes. It was a dark little tale about a man who found a magic cup and learned that if he wept into the cup, his tears turned into pearls. But even though he had always been poor, he was a happy man and rarely shed a tear. So he found ways to make himself sad so that his tears could make him rich. As the pearls piled up, so did his greed grow. The story ended with the man sitting on a mountain of pearls, knife in hand, weeping helplessly into the cup with his beloved wife's slain body in his arms.
* I want to tear myself from this place, from this reality, rise up like a cloud and float away, melt into this humid summer night and dissolve somewhere far, over the hills. But I am here, my legs blocks of concrete, my lungs empty of air, my throat burning. There will be no floating away.
* Better to get hurt by the truth than comforted with a lie.
* War doesn't negate decency. It demands it, even more than in times of peace.
* One time, when I was very little, I climbed a tree and ate these green, sour apples. My stomach swelled and became hard like a drum, it hurt a lot. Mother said that if I'd just waited for the apples to ripen, I wouldn't have become sick. So now, whenever I really want something, I try to remember what she said about the apples.
* some stories don't need telling
* You've always been a tourist here. You just didn't know it.
* I'm so afraid. Because I'm so profoundly happy. Happiness like this is frightening...They only let you this happy if they're preparing to take something from you.
* The problem, of course, was that [he] saw the world in black and white. And he got to decide what was black and what was white. You can't love a person who lives that way without fearing him too. Maybe even hating him a little.
* I opened my mouth, almost said something. Almost. The rest of my life might have turned out differently if I had. But I didn’t.
#### 1984
* Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.
* Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.
* War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.
* The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.
* If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.
* We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.
* Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.
* Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.
* If you loved someone, you loved him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love.
* In the face of pain there are no heroes.
#### Little Women
* I like good strong words that mean something…
* I am not afraid of storms, for I am learning how to sail my ship.
* I'd rather take coffee than compliments just now.
* There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and the sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.
* Love Jo all your days, if you choose, but don't let it spoil you, for it's wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can't have the one you want.
* I want to do something splendid...something heroic or wonderful that won't be forgotten after I'm dead. I don't know what, but I'm on the watch for it and mean to astonish you all someday.
* ...for love casts out fear, and gratitude can conquer pride.
* My child, the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning, and may be many; but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly one. The more you love and trust Him, the nearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom. His love and care never tire or change, can never be taken from you, but may become the source of lifelong peace, happiness, and strength. Believe this heartily, and go to God with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother.
* Be worthy love, and love will come.
* You don’t need scores of suitors. You need only one… if he’s the right one.
* Some people seemed to get all sunshine, and some all shadow…
* Conceit spoils the finest genius.
* ...the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them copy.
#### The Life of Pi
* It is true that those we meet can change us, sometimes so profoundly that we are not the same afterwards, even unto our names.
* I must say a word about fear. It is life's only true opponent. Only fear can defeat life. It is a clever, treacherous adversary, how well I know. It has no decency, respects no law or convention, shows no mercy. It goes for your weakest spot, which it finds with unnerving ease. It begins in your mind, always ... so you must fight hard to express it. You must fight hard to shine the light of words upon it. Because if you don't, if your fear becomes a wordless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you.
* Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous, possessive love that grabs at what it can. But life leaps over oblivion lightly, losing only a thing or two of no importance, and gloom is but the passing shadow of a cloud...
* When you've suffered a great deal in life, each additional pain is both unbearable and trifling.
* If we, citizens, do not support our artists, then we sacrifice our imagination on the altar of crude reality and we end up believing in nothing and having worthless dreams.
* It's important in life to conclude things properly. Only then can you let go. Otherwise you are left with words you should have said but never did, and your heart is heavy with remorse.
* I've never forgotten him. Dare I say I miss him? I do. I miss him. I still see him in my dreams. They are nightmares mostly, but nightmares tinged with love. Such is the strangeness of the human heart. I still cannot understand how he could abandon me so unceremoniously, without any sort of goodbye, without looking back even once. The pain is like an axe that chops my heart.
* If you stumble about believability, what are you living for? Love is hard to believe, ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist. God is hard to believe, ask any believer. What is your problem with hard to believe?
* You must take life the way it comes at you and make the best of it.
* To lose a brother is to lose someone with whom you can share the experience of growing old, who is supposed to bring you a sister-in-law and nieces and nephews, creatures who people the tree of your life and give it new branches. To lose your father is to lose the one whose guidance and help you seek, who supports you like a tree trunk supports its branches. To lose your mother, well, that is like losing the sun above you. It is like losing--I'm sorry, I would rather not go on.
* You might think I lost all hope at that point. I did. And as a result I perked up and felt much better.
* All living things contain a measure of madness that moves them in strange, sometimes inexplicable ways. This madness can be saving; it is part and parcel of the ability to adapt. Without it, no species would survive.
* These people fail to realize that it is on the inside that God must be defended, not on the outside. They should direct their anger at themselves. For evil in the open is but evil from within that has been let out. The main battlefield for good is not the open ground of the public arena but the small clearing of each heart.
* If there's only one nation in the sky, shouldn't all passports be valid for it?
* Life will defend itself no matter how small it is.
* I suppose in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go, but what always hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.
* If Christ spent an anguished night in prayer, if He burst out from the Cross, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' then surely we are also permitted doubt. But we must move on. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.
* What a terrible thing it is to botch a farewell. I am a person who believes in form, in the harmony of order. Where we can, we must give things a meaningful shape. For example - I wonder - could you tell my jumbled story in exactly one hundred chapters, not one more, not one less? I'll tell you, that's one thing I have about my nickname, the way the number runs on forever. It's important in life to conclude things properly. Only then can you let go. Otherwise you are left with words you should have said but never did, and your heart is heavy with remorse. That bungled goodbye hurts me to this day. I wish so much that I'd had one last look at him in the lifeboat, that I'd provoked him a little, so that I was on his mind. I wish I had said to him then - yes, I know, to a tiger, but still - I wish I had said, "Richard Parker, it's over. We have survived. Can you believe it? I owe you more gratitude than I can express I couldn't have done it without you. I would like to say it formally: Richard Parker, thank you. Thank you for saving my life. And now go where you must. You have known the confined freedom of a zoo most of your life; now you will know the free confinement of a jungle. I wish you all the best with it. Watch out for Man. He is not your friend. But I hope you will remember me as a friend. I will never forget you , that is certain. You will always be with me, in my heart. What is that hiss? Ah, our boat has touched sand. So farewell, Richard Parker, farewell. God be with you.
* I know zoos are no longer in people's good graces. Religion faces the same problem. Certain illusions about freedom plague them both.
* That's what fiction is about, isn't it, the selective transforming of reality? The twisting of it to bring out its essence?
* The presence of God is the finest of rewards.
* I was giving up. I would have given up - if a voice hadn't made itself heard in my heart. The voice said "I will not die. I refuse it. I will make it through this nightmare. I will beat the odds, as great as they are. I have survived so far, miraculously. Now I will turn miracle into routine. The amazing will be seen everyday. I will put in all the hard work necessary. Yes, so long as God is with me, I will not die. Amen."
* Misery loves company, and madness calls it forth.
#### One Hundred Years of Solitude
* It's enough for me to be sure that you and I exist at this moment.
* There is always something left to love.
* He dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found love, because by trying to make her love him he ended up falling in love with her. Petra Cotes, for her part, loved him more and more as she felt his love increasing, and that was how in the ripeness of autumn she began to believe once more in the youthful superstition that poverty was the servitude of love. Both looked back then on the wild revelry, the gaudy wealth, and the unbridled fornication as an annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to find the paradise of shared solitude. Madly in love after so many years of sterile complicity, they enjoyed the miracle of living each other as much at the table as in bed, and they grew to be so happy that even when they were two worn-out people they kept on blooming like little children and playing together like dogs.
* Then he made one last effort to search in his heart for the place where his affection had rotted away, and he could not find it.
* ...time was not passing...it was turning in a circle...
* They were so close to each other that they preferred death to separation.
* He really had been through death, but he had returned because he could not bear the solitude.
* Wherever they might be they always remember that the past was a lie, that memory has no return, that every spring gone by could never be recovered, and that the wildest and most tenacious love was an ephemeral truth in the end.
* Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.
* and both of them remained floating in an empty universe where the only everyday & eternal reality was love...
* Before reaching the final line, however, he had already understood that he would never leave that room, for it was foreseen that the city of mirrors (or mirages) would be wiped out by the wind and exiled from the memory of men at the precise moment when Aureliano Babilonia would finish deciphering the parchments, and that everything written on them was unrepeatable since time immemorial and forever more, because races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth.
* Gaston was not only a fierce lover, with endless wisdom and imagination, but he was also, perhaps, the first man in the history of the species who had made an emergency landing and had come close to killing himself and his sweetheart simply to make love in a field of violets.
* Lost in the solitude of his immense power, he began to lose direction.
* "Things have a life of their own," the gypsy proclaimed with a harsh accent. "It's simply a matter of waking up their souls."
* Death really did not matter to him but life did, and therefore the sensation he felt when they gave their decision was not a feeling of fear but of nostalgia.
* Thus they went on living in a reality that was slipping away, momentarily captured by words, but which would escape irremediably when they forgot the values of the written letters.
* The secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude.
* He soon acquired the forlorn look that one sees in vegetarians.
* The world was reduced to the surface of her skin and her inner self was safe from all bitterness.
* He pleaded so much that he lost his voice. His bones began to fill with words.
#### The Little Prince
* And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.
* All grown-ups were once children... but only few of them remember it.
* It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.
* "What makes the desert beautiful," said the little prince, "is that somewhere it hides a well..."
* The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.
* "People have forgotten this truth," the fox said. "But you mustn’t forget it. You become responsible forever for what you’ve tamed. You’re responsible for your rose."
* Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.
* It is such a mysterious place, the land of tears.
* Well, I must endure the presence of a few caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies.
* You're beautiful, but you're empty...One couldn't die for you. Of course, an ordinary passerby would think my rose looked just like you. But my rose, all on her own, is more important than all of you together, since she's the one I've watered. Since she's the one I put under glass, since she's the one I sheltered behind the screen. Since she's the one for whom I killed the caterpillars (except the two or three butterflies). Since she's the one I listened to when she complained, or when she boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing at all. Since she's my rose.
* You see, one loves the sunset when one is so sad.
* “Where are the people?” resumed the little prince at last. “It’s a little lonely in the desert…” “It is lonely when you’re among people, too,” said the snake.
* If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers...
* All men have stars, but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems... But all these stars are silent. You-You alone will have stars as no one else has them... In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars will be laughing when you look at the sky at night..You, only you, will have stars that can laugh! And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me... You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure... It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh.
* And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure . . . And your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, 'Yes, the stars always make me laugh!' And they will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you...
* She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little stratagems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her...
* Grown-ups love figures... When you tell them you've made a new friend they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you "What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies? " Instead they demand "How old is he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make? " Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.
* I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of crying a bit if one allows oneself to be tamed.
* A rock pile ceases to be a rock pile the moment a single man contemplates it, bearing within him the image of a cathedral.
* In those days, I didn't understand anything. I should have judged her according to her actions, not her words. She perfumed my planet and lit up my life. I should never have run away! I ought to have realized the tenderness underlying her silly pretensions. Flowers are so contradictory! But I was too young to know how to love her.
* But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world.
* I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn’t much improved my opinion of them.
#### Les Misérables
* He never went out without a book under his arm, and he often came back with two.
* Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.
* What Is Love? I have met in the streets a very poor young man who was in love. His hat was old, his coat worn, the water passed through his shoes and the stars through his soul.
* To love another person is to see the face of God.
* The power of a glance has been so much abused in love stories, that it has come to be disbelieved in. Few people dare now to say that two beings have fallen in love because they have looked at each other. Yet it is in this way that love begins, and in this way only.
* It is nothing to die. It is frightful not to live.
* Not being heard is no reason for silence.
* Laughter is sunshine, it chases winter from the human face.
* To love or have loved, that is enough. Ask nothing further. There is no other pearl to be found in the dark folds of life.
* Those who do not weep, do not see.
* If I speak, I am condemned. If I stay silent, I am damned!
* You who suffer because you love, love still more. To die of love, is to live by it.
* Teach the ignorant as much as you can; society is culpable in not providing a free education for all and it must answer for the night which it produces. If the soul is left in darkness sins will be committed. The guilty one is not he who commits the sin, but he who causes the darkness.
* You ask me what forces me to speak? a strange thing; my conscience.
* A garden to walk in and immensity to dream in--what more could he ask? A few flowers at his feet and above him the stars.
* There is nothing like a dream to create the future.
* Life's great happiness is to be convinced we are loved.
* He was fond of books, for they are cool and sure friends.
* The future has several names. For the weak, it is impossible; for the fainthearted, it is unknown; but for the valiant, it is ideal.
* The pupil dilates in darkness and in the end finds light, just as the soul dilates in misfortune and in the end finds God.
* When love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred and angelic unity, the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are concerned; they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries of the same destiny; they are no longer anything but the two wings of the same spirit. Love, soar.
* He fell to the seat, she by his side. There were no more words. The stars were beginning to shine. How was it that the birds sing, that the snow melts, that the rose opens, that May blooms, that the dawns whitens behind the black trees on the shivering summit of the hills?
  One kiss, and that was all.
  Both trembled, and they looked at each other in the darkness with brilliant eyes.
  They felt neither the cool night, nor the cold stone, nor the damp ground, nor the wet grass; they looked at each other, and their hearts were full of thought. They had clasped hands, without knowing it.
  She did not ask him; did not even think where and how he had managed to get into the garden. It seemed so natural to her that he should be there.
  From time to time Marius’ knee touched Cosette’s. A touch that thrilled.
  At times, Cosette faltered out a word. Her soul trembled on her lips like a drop of dew on a flower.
  Gradually, they began to talk. Overflow succeeded to silence, which is fullness. The night was serene and glorious above their heads. These two beings, pure as spirits, told each other everything, their dreams, their frenzies, their ecstasies, their chimeras, their despondencies, how they had adored each other from afar, how they had longed for each other, their despair when they had ceased to see each other. They had confided to each other in an intimacy of the ideal, which already, nothing could have increased, all that was most hidden and most mysterious in themselves. They told each other, with a candid faith in their illusions, all that love, youth and the remnant of childhood that was theirs, brought to mind. These two hearts poured themselves out to each other, so that at the end of an hour, it was the young man who had the young girl’s soul and the young girl who had the soul of the young man. They interpenetrated, they enchanted, they dazzled each other.
  When they had finished, when they had told each other everything, she laid her head on his shoulder, and asked him: "What is your name?"
  "My name is Marius," he said. "And yours?"
  "My name is Cosette."
* There is always more misery among the lower classes than there is humanity in the higher.
* Before him he saw two roads, both equally straight; but he did see two; and that terrified him--he who had never in his life known anything but one straight line. And, bitter anguish, these two roads were contradictory.
* Love is the foolishness of men, and the wisdom of God.
* There is something more terrible than a hell of suffering--a hell of boredom.
* I have been loving you a little more every minute since this morning.
* ...Nobody knows like a woman how to say things that are both sweet and profound. Sweetness and depth, this is all of woman; this is Heaven.

#### Jane Eyre
* I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.
* I would always rather be happy than dignified.
* Do you think I am an automaton? — a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! — I have as much soul as you — and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh: it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal — as we are!
* I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.
* Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs.
* I do not think, sir, you have any right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.
* I have for the first time found what I can truly love–I have found you. You are my sympathy–my better self–my good angel–I am bound to you with a strong attachment. I think you good, gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you, draws you to my center and spring of life, wrap my existence about you–and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
* If all the world hated you and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved of you and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.
* I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances require me so to do. I need not sell my soul to buy bliss. I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford to give.
* Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilized by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
* Every atom of your flesh is as dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.
* I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously revived, great and strong! He made me love him without looking at me.
* Flirting is a woman’s trade, one must keep in practice.
* All my heart is yours, sir: it belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest of me from your presence forever.
* The soul, fortunately, has an interpreter - often an unconscious but still a faithful interpreter - in the eye.
* I have little left in myself -- I must have you. The world may laugh -- may call me absurd, selfish -- but it does not signify. My very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame.
* I ask you to pass through life at my side—to be my second self, and best earthly companion.
* "It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be helped? Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
  I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
  "Because, he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you - especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame. And if that boisterous channel, and two hundred miles or so of land some broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly. As for you, - you'd forget me."
* It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquility: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, to absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
* Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.
* We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence.
* There is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
* It does good to no woman to be flattered [by a man] who does not intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and responded to, must lead, ignis-fatuus-like, into miry wilds whence there is no extrication.
* Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour ... If at my convenience I might break them, what would be their worth?
* Good-night, my-" He stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me.

#### Lolita
* It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight.
* And the rest is rust and stardust.
* He broke my heart. You merely broke my life.
* Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the
tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at
three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning,
standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly
at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was
always Lolita. Did she have a precursor? She did, indeed she did. In point
of fact, there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved, one
summer, an initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea. Oh when?
About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer.
You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style. Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the
misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle
of thorns.
* Human life is but a series of footnotes to a vast obscure unfinished masterpiece.
* I need you, the reader, to imagine us, for we don't really exist if you don't.
* Words without experience are meaningless.
* I knew I had fallen in love with Lolita forever; but I also knew she would not be forever Lolita.
* All at once we were madly, clumsily, shamelessly, agonizingly in love with each other; hopelessly, I should add, because that frenzy of mutual possession might have been assuaged only by our actually imbibing and assimilating every particle of each other's soul and flesh; but there we were, unable even to mate as slum children would have so easily found an opportunity to do so.
* We loved each other with a premature love, marked by a fierceness that so often destroys adult lives.
* I looked and looked at her, and I knew, as clearly as I know that I will die, that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth. She was only the dead-leaf echo of the nymphet from long ago - but I loved her, this Lolita, pale and polluted and big with another man's child. She could fade and wither - I didn't care. I would still go mad with tenderness at the mere sight of her face.
* And presently I was driving through the drizzle of the dying day, with the windshield wipers in full action but unable to cope with my tears.
* Perhaps, somewhere, some day, at a less miserable time, we may see each other again.
* You have to be an artist and a madman, a creature of infinite melancholy, with a bubble of hot poison in your loins and a super-voluptuous flame permanently aglow in your subtle spine (oh, how you have to cringe and hide!), in order to discern at once, by ineffable signs―the slightly feline outline of a cheekbone, the slenderness of a downy limbs, and other indices which despair and shame and tears of tenderness forbid me to tabulate―the little deadly demon among the wholesome children; she stands unrecognized by them and unconscious herself of her fantastic power.
* Life is short. From here to that old car you know so well there is a stretch of twenty, twenty-five paces. It is a very short walk. Make those twenty-five steps. Now. Right now. Come just as you are. And we shall live happily ever after.
* I have often noticed that we are inclined to endow our friends with the stability of type that literary characters acquire in the reader's mind. [...] Whatever evolution this or that popular character has gone through between the book covers, his fate is fixed in our minds, and, similarly, we expect our friends to follow this or that logical and conventional pattern we have fixed for them. Thus X will never compose the immortal music that would clash with the second-rate symphonies he has accustomed us to. Y will never commit murder. Under no circumstances can Z ever betray us. We have it all arranged in our minds, and the less often we see a particular person, the more satisfying it is to check how obediently he conforms to our notion of him every time we hear of him. Any deviation in the fates we have ordained would strike us as not only anomalous but unethical. We could prefer not to have known at all our neighbor, the retired hot-dog stand operator, if it turns out he has just produced the greatest book of poetry his age has seen.
* I recall certain moments, let us call them icebergs in paradise, when after having had my fill of her –after fabulous, insane exertions that left me limp and azure-barred–I would gather her in my arms with, at last, a mute moan of human tenderness (her skin glistening in the neon light coming from the paved court through the slits in the blind, her soot-black lashes matted, her grave gray eyes more vacant than ever–for all the world a little patient still in the confusion of a drug after a major operation)–and the tenderness would deepen to shame and despair, and I would lull and rock my lone light Lolita in my marble arms, and moan in her warm hair, and caress her at random and mutely ask her blessing, and at the peak of this human agonized selfless tenderness (with my soul actually hanging around her naked body and ready to repent), all at once, ironically, horribly, lust would swell again–and 'oh, no,' Lolita would say with a sigh to heaven, and the next moment the tenderness and the azure–all would be shattered.
* We live not only in a world of thoughts, but also in a world of things. Words without experience are meaningless.
* if a violin string could ache, I would be that string.
* I am sufficiently proud of my knowing something to be modest about my not knowing all.
* We had been everywhere. We had really seen nothing. And I catch myself thinking today that our long journey had only defiled with a sinuous trail of slime the lovely, trustful, dreamy, enormous country that by then, in retrospect, was no more to us than a collection of dog-eared maps, ruined tour books, old tires, and her sobs in the night — every night, every night — the moment I feigned sleep.
#### As you like it
* The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.
* Love is merely a madness.
#### All's Well That Ends Well
* Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.
#### Macbeth
* Stars, hide your fires; Let not light see my black and deep desires.

#### The Tempest
* Hell is empty and all the devils are here.
* We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.
* What's past is prologue.
* Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
As I foretold you, were all spirits and
Are melted into air, into thin air:
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
The cloud-capp’d towers, the gorgeous palaces,
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
As dreams are made on, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep.
* Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments
Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
The clouds methought would open, and show riches
Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked,
I cried to dream again.
* Let us not burthen our remembrance with A heaviness that's gone.
* Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows.
*  I would not wish any companion in the world but you.
#### Julies Caesar
* Men at some time are masters of their fates. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.
* Cowards die many times before their deaths;
  The valiant never taste of death but once.
  Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
  It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
  Seeing that death, a necessary end,
  Will come when it will come.
* The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones.
* There is a tide in the affairs of men
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat;
And we must take the current when it serves,
Or lose our ventures.
* And since you know you cannot see yourself,
so well as by reflection, I, your glass,
will modestly discover to yourself,
that of yourself which you yet know not of.
* There are no tricks in plain and simple faith.
* Bid me run, and I will strive with things impossible.
* But I am constant as the Northern Star,
Of whose true fixed and resting quality
There is no fellow in the firmament.
#### Hamlet
* Doubt thou the stars are fire;
Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
But never doubt I love.
* There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.
* This above all: to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
* To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd!
* There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
* Brevity is the soul of wit.

And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest. 
* When sorrows come, they come not single spies. But in battalions!
* God hath given you one face, and you make yourself another.
* Sweets to the sweet.
* I must be cruel only to be kind; Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
* If we are true to ourselves, we can not be false to anyone.
* I loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers could not, with all their quantity of love, make up my sum.
* So full of artless jealousy is guilt, It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
* To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.
#### Twelfth Night
* Be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them.
* If music be the food of love, play on,
Give me excess of it; that surfeiting,
The appetite may sicken, and so die.
* Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.
* Journeys end in lovers meeting.

* Love sought is good, but giv'n unsought is better.
* Olivia: How does he love me?
Viola: With adoration, with fertile tears, With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
* She never told her love, but let concealment, like a worm 'i th' bud, feed on her damask cheek. She pinned in thought; and, with a green and yellow melancholy, she sat like Patience on a monument, smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed? We men may say more, swear more; but indeed our shows are more than will; for we still prove much in our vows but little in our love.
* In nature there's no blemish but the mind.
None can be called deformed but the unkind.
* I have unclasp'd to thee the book even of my secret soul.
* Antonio: Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?
Sebastian: By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me; the malignancy of my fate might, perhaps, distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you.
* My stars shine darkly over me.
* Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?
#### Tropic of Cancer
* I need to be alone. I need to ponder my shame and my despair in seclusion; I need the sunshine and the paving stones of the streets without companions, without conversation, face to face with myself, with only the music of my heart for company.
* To have her here in bed with me, breathing on me, her hair in my mouth—I count that something of a miracle.
* And for that one moment of freedom you have to listen to all that love crap... it drive me nuts sometimes... I want to kick them out immediately... I do now and then. But that doesn't keep them away. They like it, in fact. The less you notice them the more they chase after you.
* Words are loneliness.
* I believe that today more than ever a book should be sought after even if it has only one great page in it. We must search for fragments, splinters, toenails, anything that has ore in it, anything that is capable of resuscitating the body and the soul.
* Do anything, but let it produce joy. Do anything, but let it yield ecstasy.
* Paris is like a whore. From a distance she seems ravishing, you can't wait until you have her in your arms. And five minutes later you feel empty, disgusted with yourself. You feel tricked.
* On the meridian of time, there is no injustice: there is only the poetry of motion creating the illusion of truth and drama.
* "You must be life for me to the very end," so he writes. "That is the only way in which to sustain my idea of you. Because you have gotten, as you see, tied up with something so vital to me, I do not think I shall ever shake you off. Nor do I wish to. I want you to live more vitally every day, as I am dead. That is why, when I speak of you to others, I am just a bit ashamed. It's hard to talk of one's self so intimately.
* When I realize that she is gone, perhaps gone forever, a great void opens up and I feel that I am falling, falling, falling into deep, black space. And this is worse than tears, deeper than regret or pain or sorrow, it is the abyss into which Satan was plunged. There is no climbing back, no ray of light, no sound of human voice or human touch of hand.
* ...the monstrous thing is not that men have created roses out of this dung heap, but that, for some reason or other, they should want roses. For some reason or other man looks for the miracle, and to accomplish it he will wade through blood. He will debauch himself with ideas, he will reduce himself to a shadow if for only one second of his life he can close his eyes to the hideousness of reality. Everything is endured- disgrace, humiliation, poverty, war, crime, ennui- in the belief that overnight something will occur, a miracle, which will render life tolerable. And all the while a meter is running inside and there is no hand that can reach in there and shut it off.
* Well, I'll take these pages and move on. Things are happening elsewhere. Things are always happening. It seems wherever I go there is drama. People are like lice - they get under your skin and bury themselves there. You scratch and scratch until the blood comes, but you can't get permanently deloused. Everywhere I go people are making a mess of their lives. Everyone has his private tragedy. It's in the blood now - misfortune, ennui, grief, suicide. The atmosphere is saturated with disaster, frustration, futility. Scratch and scratch, until there's no skin left. However, the effect upon me is exhilarating. Instead of being discouraged or depressed, I enjoy it. I am crying for more and more disasters, for bigger calamities, grander failures. I want the whole world to be out of whack, I want every one to scratch himself to death.
* For a hundred years or more the world, our world, has been dying. And not one man, in these last hundred years or so, has been crazy enough to put a bomb up the asshole of creation and set it off. The world is rotting away, dying piecemeal. But it needs the coup de grace, it needs to be blown to smithereens. Not one of us is intact, and yet we have in us all the continents and the seas between the continents and the birds of the air. We are going to put it down ― the evolution of this world which has died but which has not been buried.
#### A Midsummer Night's Dreams
* Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
  And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
* The course of true love never did run smooth.
* And yet,to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays.
* Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
More than cool reason ever comprehends.
The lunatic, the lover and the poet
Are of imagination all compact:
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
* My soul is in the sky.
* If we shadows have offended,
Think but this, and all is mended,
That you have but slumbered here
While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,
Gentles, do not reprehend:
If you pardon, we will mend:
And, as I am an honest Puck,
If we have unearned luck
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
We will make amends ere long;
Else the Puck a liar call;
So, good night unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.
* The lunatic, the lover, and the poet, are of imagination all compact.
* I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine.
* Love's stories written in love's richest books.
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.
* So we grew together,
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
But yet an union in partition,
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem.
* And sleep, that sometime shuts up sorrow's eye, Steal me awhile from mine own company.
* For you, in my respect, are all the world.
Then how can it be said I am alone
When all the world is here to look on me?
* Things base and vile, holding no quantity,
Love can transpose to form and dignity.
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.
* If we shadows have offended,
Know but this and all is mended.
That you have but slumbered here,
While these visions did appear,
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding, but a dream.
#### Animal Farm
* All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.
#### Gone with the Wind
* Burdens are for shoulders strong enough to carry them.
#### Romeo and Juliet
* Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,  That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
* thus with a kiss I die.
* Don't waste your love on somebody, who doesn't value it.
* Love is heavy and light, bright and dark, hot and cold, sick and healthy, asleep and awake- its everything except what it is! 
* Do not swear by the moon, for she changes constantly. then your love would also change.
* What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet.
* Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs.
#### A Tale of Two Cities
* A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the book should shut with a a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbor is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end. In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?
* It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.
* It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.
I wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul.
I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss. I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy. I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.
There is prodigious strength in sorrow and despair.  
#### Great Expectation
* I loved her against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be.  
* Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but - I hope - into a better shape.
* Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was better after I had cried, than before--more sorry, more aware of my own ingratitude, more gentle.  
* In a word, I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong.
* There was a long hard time when I kept far from me the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth.
* The broken heart. You think you will die, but you just keep living, day after day after terrible day.
* Ask no questions, and you'll be told no lies.
* Spring is the time of year when it is summer in the sun and winter in the shade.
* You are part of my existence, part of myself. You have been in every line I have ever read, since I first came here, the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been in every prospect I have ever seen since-on the river, on the sails of the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the darkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with.
#### A Song of Ice and Fire
* Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night, and all the nights to come. 
* My old grandmother always used to say, Summer friends will melt away like summer snows, but winter friends are friends forever. 
* History is a wheel, for the nature of man is fundamentally unchanging. What has happened before will perforce happen again. 
* The great thing about reading is that it broadens your life. 
* A day will come when you think yourself safe and happy, and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth, and you'll know the debt is paid. 
* Soon comes the cold, and the night that never ends.
* You mistake patience for forbearance. 
#### The Lord of the Rings
* Moonlight drowns out all but the brightest stars.
* And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring﻿ passed out of all knowledge.
* I would rather spend one lifetime with you, than face all the ages of this world alone.
* Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
#### The Hobbit
* Where there's life there's hope.
#### Flipped
* Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss...." He turned to me. "But every once in a while, you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare."
#### A Christmas Carol
* It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humour.
#### The Great Gatsby
* So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.
* Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.
* I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.
* And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.
* He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.
* I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity.
* In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
* "Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."
* Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.
* Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope.
* So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.
* I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others--young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.
* His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed like a flower and the incarnation was complete.
* In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.
### Lines
#### The Hobbit Three
* If this is love, I don't want it. (crying) Why does it hurt so much?
Because it is real.
#### Sherlock Holmes Season Four
* The problems of your past, are your business. The problems of your future, are my privilege.

### Poems
#### Sonnet 18
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
        So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
        So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

#### When We Two Parted
When we two parted
   In silence and tears,
Half broken-hearted
   To sever for years,
Pale grew thy cheek and cold,
   Colder thy kiss;
Truly that hour foretold
   Sorrow to this.

The dew of the morning
   Sunk chill on my brow— 
It felt like the warning
   Of what I feel now.
Thy vows are all broken,
   And light is thy fame;
I hear thy name spoken,
   And share in its shame.

They name thee before me,
   A knell to mine ear;
A shudder comes o'er me—
   Why wert thou so dear?
They know not I knew thee,
   Who knew thee too well—
Long, long shall I rue thee,
   Too deeply to tell.

In secret we met—
   In silence I grieve,
That thy heart could forget,
   Thy spirit deceive.
If I should meet thee
   After long years,
How should I greet thee?—
   With silence and tears.
### Lyrics
#### Burnt Love Letters
It's been two weeks since your last letter
and it feels like an eternity.
When I hear the mail arrive,
my heart soars as I carefully open the envelope and savor every word. ，
It's almost like Christmas.
I wish they were all a thousand pages long
so that I would never have to stop reading.
I went into the city last week and passed by our old building. ，
Do you remember when we used to dance on the rooftop at night in the rain, ，
and you'd spin me around and my hair would get so wet it would stick to my face ，
and you had to push it out of the way just to kiss me?
And Mrs. Lourdes would always tell us we were going to catch our death up there as we passed her door on the way downstairs?
I miss trying to sneak past her door before racing you down the stairs to our flat.
just so that you'd do that silly victory dance.
Sometimes I'd let you win
I miss the excitement of those nights,
even though our clothes were soaked and it was cold. ，
I miss dancing with you in the rain.
I miss you so much.
I can't stop thinking about you.
I miss running my fingers through your hair.
Standing on tip-toes to reach your lips or
singing off key on purpose in the car to annoy Liv.
I miss your stupid jokes and the way you absent mindedly push your glasses up your nose while you're working. ，
I miss you even when I am sleeping.
I lie awake at night in the dark
and listen to the rain gently tapping the window pane
and I imagine dancing with you again
until sleep finally finds me.
My heart aches every time I wake to feel your empty place beside me. ，
I miss waking up to your smile and your warmth.
Please come home safely. I love you.，

#### Alexander Hamilton
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
spot in the Caribbean by Providence impoverished in squalor
grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

The Ten dollar, founding father without a father
got a lot farther by working a lot harder
by being a lot smarter by being a self-starter
by fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter

And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted away
across the waves he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside he was longing for something to be a part of
the brother was ready to beg steal borrow or barter

Then a hurricane came and devastation rained
our man saw his future drip-dripping down the drain
put a pencil to his temple connected it to his brain
and he wrote his first refrain a testament to his pain

Well the word got around they said this kid is insane man
took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
Get your education don't forget from whence you came. And the world is gonna know your name.
What's ya name, man?

Alexander Hamilton.
My name is Alexander Hamilton.
And there's a million things I haven't done.
But just you wait, just you, wait.

When he was 10, his father split
Full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother, bed-ridden
Half-dead, sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride
Somethin' new inside
A voice saying Alex, you gotta fend for yourself
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf

There would've been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He would've been dead and destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and other things he can't afford

Scannin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future, see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man (x4) In New York (New York) Just you wait (x3)

Alexander Hamilton
We are waiting in the weeds for you
You could never back down
You never learned to take your time
Alexander Hamilton
America Sings for you
Do they know what you overcame
Do they know you control your name
The world will never be the same, oh

The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him
Another immigrant comin' up from the bottom
His enemies destroyed his rep, America forgot him

We, fought with him
Me, I died for him
Me, I trusted him
Me, I loved him
And me, I'm the damn fool that shot him
There's a million things I haven't done, but just you wait
Whats ya name man?
ALEXANDER HAMILTON

#### 重庆森林
* 不知道什么时候开始，我变成一个很小心的人，每一次穿雨衣，我都会戴太阳眼镜，你永远都不会知道什么时候会下雨，什么时候出太阳。
* 每一架飞机上，一定有一位空中小姐是你想泡的，去年这个时候，我非常成功地在两万五千英尺的高空上泡了一个。我以为会跟她在一起很久，就象一架加满了油的飞机一样，可以飞很远。谁知道飞机中途转站……
* 不知道从什么时候开始，在什么东西上面都有个日期，秋刀鱼会过期，肉罐头会过期，连保鲜纸都会过期，我开始怀疑，在这个世界上，还有什么东西是不会过期的？ 
* 其实他不是没有来，只是走错了地方。那天晚上，我们大家都在加州，只不过我们之间相差了15个钟头，现在是他那边早上11点。不知道今天晚上8点，他会不会记得约了我呢？
* 每个人都有失恋的时候，而每一次我失恋，我都会去跑步，因为跑步可以将你身体里的水分蒸发掉，而让我不那么容易流泪，我怎么可以流泪呢？在阿May心里，我可是个很酷的男人。
* 我不知道是不是我上班的时候忘了关水龙头，还是房子越来越有感情。我一直都以为它很坚强，谁知道它会哭得这么厉害。一个人流泪的时候，你只要给她一包纸巾就够了，但是一座房子流泪的话，你就要多做很多事情了。
* 每天你都有机会和很多人擦身而过，而你或者对他们一无所知，不过也许有一天他会变成你的朋友或是知己。
* 每一个人都有一个习惯，我的习惯呢？就是来这边等阿may下班。 
* 在1994年的5月1号，有一个女人跟我讲了一声“生日快乐”，因为这一句话，我会一直记住这个女人。如果记忆也是一个罐头的话，我希望这罐罐头不会过期；如果一定要加一个日子的话，我希望她是一万年。
* 我是早上六点钟出生的，还有两分钟我就25岁了，换句话来讲，我已经在这个世界上经历了四分之一个世纪，在这个历史性的时刻，我去了跑步，我很成功地将我身体里多余的水分蒸发掉。我觉得很开心，当我要离开这个球场的时候，我留下了我的call机，因为我知道今天没有人会call我。 
* 如果记忆是一个罐头，我希望它永远不会过期。
* 她走了之后，家里很多东西都很伤心，每天晚上我都要安慰他们才能睡觉。
* 新鲜新鲜，什么新鲜啊。就是你这种人啦，贪新忘旧的。喂！弄一罐凤梨罐头要花多少心血你知道吗？又要种，又要摘，又要切，你说不要就不要啊？你有没有想过罐头的感受？
* 我们分手的那天是愚人节，所以我一直当她是开玩笑，我愿意让她这个玩笑维持一个月。从分手的那一天开始，我每天都买一罐5月1号到期的凤梨罐头，因为凤梨是阿May最爱吃的东西，而5月1号是我生日。我告诉我自己，当我买满30罐的时候，她如果还不回来，这一段感情就会过期。
* 一个女人这么晚了还戴墨镜，只有三个理由，第一个呢，就说明她是个盲子；第二个呢，就说明她在耍帅，所以才戴墨镜；第三个呢，就因为她失恋，因为她不想让人家看出来她哭过。
* 看到它哭了，我很开心，虽然它外表变了，但它依然是条感情丰富的毛巾。
* 有时候，耳朵比眼睛还重要，很多东西用耳朵听比用眼睛看好，一个人可以假装开心，但声音就装不了，仔细一听就知道了。
*  有人说狗是人类最好的朋友，可为什么在这个时候，它却不肯跟我分享我的痛苦呢？
* 那天下午我做了个梦，我到了他的家，走出那房子的时候，我以为我会醒来，谁知道，原来有些梦是永远不会醒的。
* 终于在一家便利店，让我找到第30罐凤梨罐头。就在5月1号的早晨，我开始明白一件事情，在阿May的心中，我和这个凤梨罐头没有什么分别。其实了解一个人并不代表什么，人是会变的，今天他喜欢凤梨，明天他可以喜欢别的。
* 我没有想到她说的休息就是真正的休息，整个晚上我看了两套粤语长片，吃了四次厨师沙拉。当天差不多快亮的时候，我知道我该走了。在我要走的时候，我帮她脱了鞋子。我记得我妈说过，如果女人穿着高跟鞋睡觉，第二天会脚肿。她昨天晚上一定是走了很长的路，象她这样漂亮的女人，高跟鞋应该是要很干净的才对。
* 我们最接近的时候，我跟她的距离只有0.01公分，57个小时之后，我爱上了这个女人。六个钟头之后，她喜欢了另一个男人。
